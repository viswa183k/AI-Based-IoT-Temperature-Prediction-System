# AI_IoT_Temperature_Predictor

## Description
An AI-powered IoT system using ESP32 and DHT22 sensor to monitor temperature and humidity in real time. Data is sent to ThingSpeak IoT cloud, where MATLAB analytics predict future temperature trends.

## Hardware Required
- ESP32 Development Board
- DHT22 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- Jumper Wires
- Internet Connection

## Software Required
- Arduino IDE
- ThingSpeak Account
- MATLAB Analytics (inside ThingSpeak)

## Usage
1. Connect the DHT22 sensor to ESP32 as per code.
2. Update WiFi credentials and ThingSpeak API details.
3. Upload `AI_IoT_Temperature_Predictor.ino`.
4. View real-time readings and AI-based predictions on ThingSpeak dashboard.
